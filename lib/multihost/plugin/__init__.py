"""
Pytest multihost plugin. The main functionality is to make sure that only tests
that can be run using the given multihost configuration are executed.

.. note::

    This plugin is a high level wrapper around ``pytest_multihost`` with
    additional functionality.

New command line options
========================

* ``--multihost-log-path``: multihost logs will be printed to this file, use
  ``/dev/stdout`` if you want to print them to standard output (default: none)
* ``--exact-topology``: if set only test the require exactly the multihost
  configuration that was given are run (default: false)

  .. code-block:: console

      pytest --exact-topology --multihost-log-path ./test.log --multihost-config mhc.yaml

New markers
===========

* ``@pytest.mark.topology``

  .. code-block:: python

      @pytest.mark.topology(name: str, topology:
      lib.multihost.topology.Topology, /, *, fixture1=target1, ...)

New fixtures
============

* :func:`mh`
* :func:`multihost`

New functionality
=================

* filter tests using ``@pytest.mark.topology`` and
  :class:`lib.multihost.plugin.TopologyMark`
* run only tests which topology (as set by the ``topology`` marker) is satisfied
  by given multihost configuration
* dynamically create fixtures required by the test as defined in the
  ``topology`` marker
* parametrize tests by topology, each ``topology`` marker creates one test run
